Umbraco Jet (uJet) is a Code First approach to building MVC applications in Umbraco 7. Declare your document, media, and data types in code, and have uJet move them into Umbraco for you - simplifying development, deployment and versioning.

uJet is capable of serving you with instances of your document types. With uJet you're no longer bound by the `RenderModel`, or by the constraints set by the built-in `ControllerActionInvoker`. uJet brings you strongly typed views without requiring you to roll your own view models.

uJet is a developer tool for Umbraco 7, released as Open Source (MIT). It supports document types, media types, data types, and template synchronization.
